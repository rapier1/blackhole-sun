# Templates are defined as the specifc format required to
# inject a valid route. _route_ is the CIDR format for the
# route to be blocked. Adjust next hops and communities as needed
# the variables need to be named as 'template_N' where the maximum
# of N is the total_tempates value. DO NOT use quotes around the template
# definitions. This will cause ExaBGP to fail to add the route.
