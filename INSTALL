Installation:

1) Ensure that you have the latest version of the code base from
   https://github.com/rapier1/blackhole-sun

2) Ensure that you have a functional installation of php.

3) Ensure that you have an instance of exbgp running on a *different*
   host than you'll be using for the processing engine (aka client) and the web 
   interface. Since exabgp is critical production infrastructure you want to 
   ensure that you have that system as locked odwn as possible. That means
   not have a web server running on that host. 

4) Ensure that you have openssl installed

5) Make sure that your sendmail subsystem is working correctly on the client host

6) Ensure that you have a functional installation of perl. 
   This was developed under perl v5.28.1. We will not provide any guarantees 
   that it will work as adverstised under different versions of perl. 

   For the exabgp interface you will need the following 
   perl modules installed on that server. 

   IO::Socket::INET
   IO::Socket::Timeout
   CryptX
   Crypt::PK::RSA
   Crypt::PK::DH
   Crypt::Mode::CTR
   Crypt::Random
   Config::Tiny
   Getopt::Std
   Data::Dumper
   Capture::Tiny 
   Log::Log4perl

   cpan install IO::Socket::INET IO::Socket::Timeout CryptX Crypt::PK::RSA \
                Crypt::PK::DH Crypt::Mode::CTR Crypt::Random Config::Tiny \
                Getopt::Std Data::Dumper Capture::Tiny Log::Log4perl 


   For the client (processing engine) you will need these
   perl modules:

   IO::Socket::INET
   IO::Socket::Timeout
   CryptX
   Crypt::PK::RSA
   Crypt::PK::DH
   Crypt::Mode::CTR
   Crypt::Random
   Try::Tiny
   Config::Tiny
   Getopt::Std
   Data::Dumper
   JSON
   Switch
   DBI
   Net::Netmask
   Scalar::Util
   App::Genpass 
   Email::Sender::Simple
   Email::Simple
   Email::Simple::Creator
   PHP::Functions::Password
   Log::Log4perl

   First install libssl-dev (or libssl-devel). Then install the required modules with

   cpan install IO::Socket::INET IO::Socket::Timeout CryptX CPAN::DistnameInfo\ 
                Crypt::PK::RSA Crypt::PK::DH  Crypt::Mode::CTR Math::Pari\
                Crypt::Random Config::Tiny Getopt::Std Data::Dumper \
                JSON Switch DBI Net::Netmask Scalar::Util \
                App::Genpass Email::Sender::Simple Email::Simple \
                Email::Simple::Creator PHP::Functions::Password \
		Log::Log4perl

   Note: Crypt::Random depends on Math::Pari which can be annoying to install.
   Sorry about that. I'll be lokoing at replacing Crypt::Random with another random
   number generator shortly. 

7) Now that you have the environment set up you need to do the following on the client
   webUI side

   a) Copy the php, javascipt, and various subdirectories related to the WebUI to the 
      an appropriate document directory on the webserver. 
   b) Copy client.pl to /usr/local/bin. 
   c) Copy log4perl.conf to /usr/local/etc
   d) mkdir /usr/local/etc/blackholesun
   e) mkidr /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys
   f) copy client.cfg to /usr/local/etc/blackholesun
   g) create a RSA public/private key pair for the client 
      in /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys with 
      'openssl genrsa -out client_rsa 2048'
      'rsa -in client_rsa -outform PEM -pubout -out client_rsa.pub'
   h) Load the db schema for blackhole sun into your SQL server
      with mysql -u root -p < bhs.schema.sql
   i) create an sql user for blackhole sun and grant data permissions
   j) update the client.cfg file with the appropriate information
   k) update the functions.cfg.php file with the appropriate information

8) On the server side 
  
   a) prepend your exabgp.conf file with the following
        process exabgp-interface {
                run /usr/local/bin/exabgp_interface.pl;
                encoder json;
        }
   b) copy exabgp_interface.pl to /usr/local/bin
   c) mkdir /usr/local/etc/blackholesun
   d) mkidr /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys
   e) copy exabpg_interface.cfg to /usr/local/etc/blackholesun
   f) create a RSA public/private key pair for the server 
      in /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys with
      'openssl genrsa -out server_rsa 2048'
      'rsa -in server_rsa -outform PEM -pubout -out server_rsa.pub'
   g) update eaxbgp_interface.cfg with the appropriate information

9) Copy the client_rsa.pub key to /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys
   on the exabgp host

10) Copy the server_rsa.pub key to /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/keys
    on the client host

11) Restart the exabgp process on the exabgp host

12) Start the processing engine (client) on the client host with
    /usr/local/bin/client.pl -f /usr/local/etc/blackholesun/client.cfg



Troubleshooting:

Make sure that the firewall will allow connections between the two hosts.
If the status lights indicate that the client is up but the interface or
server is down this is a possible cause. 

Make sure that the exabgp_interface process is running by getting the
status of the exabgp server via systemctl status exabgp.

Make sure that the blackholesun SQL user is configured correctly in the
SQL process and the configuration files. 

If the logs indicate a persistent problem with the cyrptographic routes
(bad keys, corrupted packet, etc) make sure that you are using RSA keys and that
you have valid public keys in the approrpriate locations.

If the webpage hangs after creating a new user, resetting a password, or modifying
a route this might be a problem with the way mail service is configured. Please
verify the settings.
